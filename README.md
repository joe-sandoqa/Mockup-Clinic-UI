# Mockup-Clinic-UI
A mockup UI for a clinic which will help with registering patients, CT scans, and more.
This UI starts off in the MainUI in which it asks for 3 options. THe first option should be selected by a receptionist registering
a new patient. The system will then create a file with a 5 digit patient ID, along with printing the information given.
The patient will then go to their appointment in which the technician operating the CT scan will get their patient ID,
and input necessary elements. Upon clicking save, a file will be created with all of the information provided by the technician.
Once the results are available, a message will be sent to the patient, in which they can go to the patient view, input their patient ID,
then see all their results. Upon clicking exit, the software will shut down.
